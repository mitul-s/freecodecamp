# Free Code Camp

Haven't heard of [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)? It's an amazing non-profit organization decidated towards helping people learn how to code! ü§ì

In this repository, you'll find the algorithms and projects that I've completed by following their curriculum. This ain't no easy stuff if you're a beginner, they push you to do some research to complete your project - no hand holding guides. Which is pretty awesome.

Anyways, I've completed a couple front-end projects and have developed a strong understanding of API implementation. I try to do the algorithms whenever I get the chance. I'll be completing more as time passes! 

So, you can stop reading this and go check out the awesome work! üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
